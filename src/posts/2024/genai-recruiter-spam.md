title: GenAI Recruiter Spam
description: I recently received an email at work from a recruiter, but
  something seemed off. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was actually
  generated by an AI based on my resume. The email included job recommendations
  and was surprisingly honest about being sent by an AI representative named
  Jenny Johnson. It's a glimpse into the future of job searching in a World Without Apps.

I received an email the other day at work from what looked like a recruiter offering to help me find a job. I was more than a little stunned at the audacity of the recruiter to send me an email to my work email address. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that a recruiter wouldn't email me at work. They all connect with me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmwargo/){target="_blank"}.

As I read through the email, I said to myself "wait a minute, this wasn't written by a person". Here, take a look at the email content:

As I saw it, someone used Generative AI (GenAI) to generate a profile based on my resume or perhaps a job application I filled out years ago. Again, I simply couldn't believe the audacity of this approach.

As I scrolled down the email, below the recommended positions based on this generated profile, I saw surprisingly honest attestation that the recruiter, Jenny Johnson, was an AI representative.

Can you imagine the profit generation aspect of this? 

1. Scour the Internet for resumes
2. Generate a profile for each
3. Scour the Internet for job postings
4. Use GenAI to match job openings for each profile
5. Send everything to an email for the target human.

Someone can do this all day every day without needing any staff. For any human that gets an email clicks on a link to submit an application, the AI team gets a referral fee for any hires. It's genius - you can do this with one guy (or gal) and pay for some cloud compute and email services and you're all set. Simply mind boggling. 

If you happen to not get an unsolicited email, all you have to do is find the site, fill in a couple of information items and enter the process. If you're looking for a job and find a job, it's the easiest thing for you ever. Here's the site, Job Title, skills and location are all it needs to use AI to find potentially hundreds or thousands of potential job openings that match.

And this is an excellent example of what happens in the World Without Apps.
