As I wrote [here](/about), I started this site because I saw that mobile apps would become less important as voice control systems using Natural Language Processing would replace some of the functionality provided by apps. I wrote a few articles over two years, then got busy with other things and let the site wane.

Fast-forward six years and the capabilities of Machine Learning have exploded dramatically in solutions like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt){target="_blank"} and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot){target="_blank"}. I used Copilot since the early beta programs and love it and as I saw the world reacting to these new capabilities I decided to start writing here again.

The site hasa  new look and feel and some additional capabilities; I migrated the site to a new platform and new hosting provider. Search works now too, so that will make the site easier to use.

I hope you enjoy this, lets see what happens here next.
